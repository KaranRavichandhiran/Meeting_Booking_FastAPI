#Meeting Booking FastAPI

A **simple Meeting Booking Management API** built with **FastAPI** and **SQLite**, designed to help users schedule meetings with **proper date and time validation**. It ensures meetings **cannot be booked in the past** or **outside working hours (08:00–20:00)** — perfect for a basic scheduler backend. ([GitHub][1])

---

## Features

*  Schedule meetings with **date and time validation**
*  Prevent bookings in the past
*  Restrict booking times to **08:00–20:00**
*  Built with FastAPI (Python) and SQLite
*  Automatically generated API docs via Swagger/UI

## Demo

Once running locally, you can try out the interactive API docs:

* **Swagger UI** — `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
* **Redoc** — `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

These interfaces let you test all API endpoints without external tools. ([GitHub][1])
